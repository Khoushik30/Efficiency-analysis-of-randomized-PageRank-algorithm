# Efficiency Analysis of Randomized PageRank Algorithm

## 📌 Overview
This project compares the traditional deterministic PageRank algorithm with a randomized version that introduces:
- **Random Hops** – occasional jumps to random pages.
- **Random Weights** – assigning different weights to outgoing links.

The goal is to analyze whether these modifications improve the algorithm’s efficiency and performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## 📊 Dataset
- Google Web Graph Dataset (Stanford SNAP)
- Also tested on synthetic graphs for controlled analysis

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
  git clone https://github.com/khoushikraj/randomized-pagerank.git cd randomized-pagerank

3. Install required libraries:
4. Run the code:
- `deterministic_pagerank.py` for original algorithm
- `randomized_pagerank.py` for modified version
- `comparison_plot.py` to visualize results
